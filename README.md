# Introduction to Machine Learning Term Project

Team project for the CS233 Introduction to Machine Learning course in EPFL. The project consists of two milestones.

## Milestone 1
- We aimed to apply the machine learning techniques
we learned in the course to a subset of the Stanford Dogs
dataset. Our objective is first to accurately identify the breed
of dogs depicted in images, and second, to determine the
precise center point of each dog within the image. 

- To achieve this, we employed linear regression and logistic
regression for regression and classification tasks
respectively, as well as k-nearest neighbors (KNN) for both
tasks. 

- We evaluate the performance of these methods using
appropriate evaluation metrics and present our findings in
the [report](https://github.com/ynarter/ML_project/blob/main/MS1/report.pdf).

## Milestone 2
- We implemented several machine learning
methods to classify images from the FashionMNIST
dataset, which contains grayscale images of various fashion
items. 

- We developed and evaluated the
performance of multiple neural network architectures,
including Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNN), and Transformer models.
Additionally, we utilized Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and assess
its impact on MLP performance.

- The results and evalutions are presented in the [report](https://github.com/ynarter/ML_project/blob/main/MS2/report.pdf).
